Hi, name is Jurijs Kovzels. This is the website of mine.

Fortunately I do not have the time to actually create a website.

I also take not particularly usefull notes.

##### On modern OS a.k.a browsers
_Where I rant about the browsers_

 * [61 Tabs and Picking What Not To Learn](/os/61-tabs-and-picking-what-not-to-learn.md)
 * [Browsers are not designed for the next larger context](/os/browsers-are-not-designed-for-next-larger-context.md)

##### On development
 * [How to setup GraphQL API as Azure Functions](/dev/deploying-graphql-to-azure-functions.md)
 * [What is GraphQL](/dev/what-is-graphql.md)
 * [Picking my poison with Libraries JS](/dev/how-da-hell-do-you-pick-your-libs.md)
 * [Notes on Google Analitics (Universal Analytics) Mesurement Protocol and Enhanced Ecommerce with Custom Dimensions](/ga-ua-mesurement-protocol-enhanced-ecommerce-custom-dimensions.md)

##### Control Rooms Freak-out

_Where I lay down my learning and thought about the design for control room interfaces, Human-MAchine Interfaces (HMI), and Control & Instrumentation. I focus on Nuclear Power Plants because nuclear is the source of beautiful energy._
