# How to pick the right non-fiction book to read

There are too many good books for you. You do not have time to waste on books which are not good for you. Every book is a trap, every book is a project.

## Step 1: Do not buy the book

Buying the book is the first step towards commuting to read the book. At least this is how it should work, but doesn’t for most of us.

It’s a difficult step to take, but do not buy the book. Even if it is discounted. Discount only affects your bank balance, but not your state of mind and self-esteem. Every book you buy increases the counter of “unfinished projects” and “unrealized dreams”.

## Step 2: Pre-reading

Reading takes a lot of spare time, and in the case of non-fiction, also a lot of work.

Invest time and effort to know about the book as much as possible before you read the book.

Every book you read is a project, it is a big-ticket item. It is similar to buying a house, but with books, you pay in your time to get knowledge and insights.

Do your research! And the good thing about doing a pre-read check is that the time you spend doing it counts towards reading the book.

**Read reviews** on amazon goodreads.com. Search for blog posts, YouTube videos.

Read the summaries. Check for blinkist. They may have a good summary to read or a shortcast to listen to.

**Search for podcasts with the author.** Authors do podcast tours when they have a new book out. Hear what they have to say (and sell), understand how they think, and communicate.

**Search Twitter for the threads on the book.** Sometimes authors summarize the book, other times people [#readinpublic](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23readinpublic&f=live)

**Read a sample chapter.** Get the demo for free. Amazon often offers to read a selected chapter for free. Other publishers to that too.

This is the most time and effort consuming part of the step, but the most important. Because you are not committed to reading the entire book, you still can get 95% of your time back, and get to keep all your money and do not have another unfinished project in your consciousness. Doing due diligence is the right thing to do.

## Step 3: Read the book

If you still think that the book is worth your time, go ahead and read it.

Changed your mind? Even better, now you have free time, the money you did not spend on the book you do not really want to read, and peace of mind.

Plus, it is better to have a ‘here is why I decided not to read the book”, rather than “I bought but didn’t read the book” conversation next time we are allowed to go see people.

Also, mind not to slip into ‘pre-reading’ without reading the book cycle. The goal is to read-only the right books for you, not to collect the list of them.

## Closing word

And one last thing. One might say: “Why would I bother reading the book when I already read the summary and understand what it is about?” It is a legit question. But …

1\. This question will never occur for _the right book for you_. You will be eager to read it, and you will regret that it is no longer when you finish it.

2\. _Knowing_ the principles and ideas expressed in the book is not the same as _living by_ them. Reading the whole thing helps engrave the ideas into your operation system. [Allen Carr’s Easy Way To Stop Smoking](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EVMK0H0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) helped thousands to quit. The book does not have any new information smokers did not know. The books manages to plant those ideas deep enough so that you can not ignore those ideas any longer. No one quit smoking reading reviews and endorsement blurbs on the back of the book.

3\. You can have it on your shelf for well-deserved virtue-signaling.
