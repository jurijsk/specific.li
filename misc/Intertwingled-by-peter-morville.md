## I hope you are sorry, Peter

Just finished Intertwingled by Peter Morville.

The book does not make any sense.

For the book about interconnectedness, nothing is connecting it in. The beginning of the paragraph does not connect with its end. Adjacent paragraphs do not connect either. The whole book is a collection of rumpling thought, association and metaphors. At times, it feels like the author was just exercising in slogan writing, and forgot to edit out his second, third and forth best takes. Jesus, person, get an editor!

The only good think about are quotes and references. Most of which wasted for nothing is connective tissue of writing.

About the physical artifact. Comically bad illustrations, and awful formatting.

The book's main point is that dichotomies are not good, I suppose.

I want my time back.
