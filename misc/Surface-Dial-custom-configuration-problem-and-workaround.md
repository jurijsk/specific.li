### Surface Dial custom configuration greyed-out problem and workaround.md

Long story short:
If one creates a custom configuration for MS Edge, Chrome and sometimes other apps you get that program greyed-out in Wheel setting with no option to change the configuration or remove it. As described [here](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/all/cant-removecustomize-surface-dial-app-tools-option/81a97d74-91ae-43fa-bbaf-3091ef95e632) and [here](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/all/cant-removecustomize-surface-dial-customization/91480c1f-5d14-4085-bb59-dde24ab824b9), both locked so no change posting here.

## Workaround

Workaround for MS Edge, it seams, is to remove the Edge user Profile and create the new one.
