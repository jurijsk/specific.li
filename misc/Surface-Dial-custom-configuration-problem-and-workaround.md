### Surface Dial custom configuration greyed-out problem and workaround

Long story short:
If one creates a custom configuration for MS Edge, Chrome, and sometimes other apps you get that program greyed-out in the Wheel Setting with no option to change the configuration or remove it. As described [here](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/all/cant-removecustomize-surface-dial-app-tools-option/81a97d74-91ae-43fa-bbaf-3091ef95e632) and [here](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/all/cant-removecustomize-surface-dial-customization/91480c1f-5d14-4085-bb59-dde24ab824b9), both locked so no change posting here.

## Workaround

Workaround for MS Edge, it seems, is to remove the Edge user Profile and create the new one. I do not have clear steps, and can not guarantee success but I managed to erase the setting for Edge 2 times to reconfigure custom tools. 

There few more caveats: 

1. For custom app-specific tools to work in Edge in the first place the profile should be synced with remove MS account.
2. The configuration for edge does not show up in the list of the custom configs, so I can not modify it or remove it.
3. Edge (edge.exe) is greyed out in the "Add an app" list.

In the end, if I need to reconfigure the actions, I will need to perform the same dance around the profiles and trickery but at least the wheel isn't a complete waste of money.

And yeah, thanks Microsoft.
